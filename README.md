# host-structPacket
This project uses STM32CubeIDE and it's a program created to practice my C habilities during the course 'Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: Absolute Beginners' from FastBit Embedded Brain Academy.

This project uses typedef struct and the packet concept.

## Results

The packet consumes 10 bytes. To improve this, check the [host-structPacketBitField](https://github.com/Rafaelatff/host-structPacketBitField) project.
